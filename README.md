# Data-mining-final-project
The main purpose of this project is to generate a report truthful in content and professional in its presentation. The final project is carried out in groups composed of 5 students. The group chooses the research questions to be studied. The questions can be complex or simple. Special consideration will be given to “out of the box” questions. The “AI/ML Salaries data” is the same for all groups. The salaries data are from ai-jobs. The data can be imported manually from Kaggle’s Website:

The project final report will include a cover page with the group’s members and a title. In the final project can consider any of the topics given in the course.
Items to be included in the report:
1. Description of the problems you wish to investigate: the research questions.
2. Description of the raw data: amount of data, number of variables, . . . . Data analysis: general feeling of the data. Data preparation: relevant aspects of the data’s pre-processing.
3. Summary of the processed data: you must include some type of graphical representation and comment on the relevant aspects of the data.
4. List of methods used, techniques explored while solving the problems, . . .
5. Description of the experimental results and its evaluation.
6. Final conclusions.


This project aims to discover the factors or patterns that can help find a well-paying job in the field of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Big Data. It is focused on extracting information from the past year, which is considered the best approximation for the next year, in which you want to find a job. Specifically, it seeks to discover how to find a full-time job.
To do so, different Data Mining techniques will be used, including both supervised and unsupervised learning. These cover classification techniques such as Decision Trees and Naive Bayes. Clustering techniques, such as k-modes, and Association rules with Apriori method, are also employed. All these methods will help to answer a series of questions, the answers to which will provide us with the necessary information to obtain the knowledge we are looking for.
