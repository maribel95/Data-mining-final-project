# Data-mining-final-project
The main purpose of this project is to generate a report truthful in content and professional in its presentation. The final project is carried out in groups composed of 5 students. The group chooses the research questions to be studied. The questions can be complex or simple. Special consideration will be given to “out of the box” questions. The “AI/ML Salaries data” is the same for all groups. The salaries data are from ai-jobs. The data can be imported manually from Kaggle’s Website:
